/**
 * The analyst stage: grounding and classification, the same for both investigators.
 *
 * Grounding rule (roadmap §6): every claim must cite evidence ids that a tool RETURNED IN THIS
 * RUN. A claim that cites nothing, or cites any id no tool returned (an invented record, a
 * typo, an id remembered from another run), is dropped and counted — never repaired, because
 * a claim whose evidence is wrong cannot be trusted for its other ids either.
 *
 * Classification: a "verified" claim must rest on at least one stored record; one that cites
 * only metric definitions is downgraded to a hypothesis (a formula proves nothing about the
 * data). Hypotheses without a stated strength are weak. The result groups into verified
 * findings, strong hypotheses, weak hypotheses and missing information.
